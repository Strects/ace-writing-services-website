[{"content":"What is an accessibility statement? An accessibility statement is a public document that communicates what an organisation is doing to provide digital products, services, and content that are accessible to disabled people.\nWhy should organisations have accessibility statements? Accessibility statements are important for three reasons:\nthey demonstrate the organisation\u0026rsquo;s commmitment to accessibility and equity; they provide users with information about how accessible the organisation\u0026rsquo;s content is and what the current shortfalls are; and they demonstrate a commitment to accessibility and corporate social responsibility. Depending on where your organisation is registered, you may be required to publish an accessibility statement as per the EU Web Accessibility Directive.\nWhere should accessibility statements be placed? Accessibility statements should be easy to find and accessible from multiple places, such as within a website\u0026rsquo;s footer, navigation menu, about page and other areas that are highly visited.\nSummary Ultimately, accessibility is important to ensure all users can navigate an organisation\u0026rsquo;s content freely and without restriction. By publishing an accessibility statement, an organisation demonstrates its commitment to accessibility, as well as being proactive in recognising how it has ensured accessibility and also acknowledging what needs to be improved.\nInterested in having a comprehensive accessibility statement produced for your organisation?\nContact Ace Writing Services today via Discord at strects. or by email at contact@acewritingservices.co.uk.\n","date":"2025-08-17","id":0,"permalink":"/blog/the-importance-of-accessibility-statements/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-an-accessibility-statement\"\u003eWhat is an accessibility statement?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn accessibility statement is a public document that communicates what an organisation is doing to provide digital products, services, and content that are accessible to disabled people.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"The Importance of Accessibility Statements"},{"content":"Welcome to the new website!

If you do not agree with all of the clauses in this agreement in exhaustive capacity, you should cease your interactions and usage of Countr (the “Bot”).\nWe strongly recommend that you also read Countr’s Terms of Service so you are able to ascertain a full understanding of our commitment to our users’ safety.\nPersonal Data We Collect About You We only collect data about our users when it is necessary for Countr to function and achieve its expected outcomes. The data that we collect is only for our own legitimate interests and we only use it in ways that are explicitly specified in this Privacy Policy.\nIt is necessary for us to collect the following information:\nguild identifiers (“IDs”) channel identifiers (“IDs”) user identifiers (“IDs”). Please note that user IDs may also be collected and stored due to an administrator or authorised individual importing or setting a user’s score manually. A “guild” is defined as an “isolated collection of users and channels”, as defined by Discord’s Developer Documentation. It is referred to in the user interface as a “server”.\nCountr does not keep a temporary or perpetual store of messages sent outside of channels designated as “counting channels”, wherein users can send messages for the purpose of counting, following on from the previous users. In this instance, messages are stored only for the purpose of satisfying core functionality agreed upon by an authorised server representative.\nSome data may be temporarily stored by means of cache. With relevance to Discord, cache is a software component that stores data so that information can be served faster at a later point in time. Items stored in cache may include:\nGuild IDs and guild information that is publicly available; User IDs and user information that is publicly available. When interacting with our Website(s) (https://countr.xyz, https://*.countr.pages.dev), we may store cookies. Simply, cookies are small pieces of information in the form of a text file, containing a string of letters and numbers.

This information is only accessible to Promise#0001, with user identifier 110090225929191424, hereby referenced to as the Bot Creator.\nWhy We Collect Data About You Data is collected solely for the purpose of providing a service to you. We collect the information below for the specified reasons.\nGuild IDs are collected for the purpose of the Bot being able to distinguish between guilds and to associate data with a guild so the Bot can run on preferred settings; Channel IDs are collected for the purpose of identifying and associating internally counting channels with certain predefined settings; User IDs are collected for the purpose of the Bot being able to tell different users apart, and maintain statistics. Cookies are collected for the purpose of optimising your experience on the Website and allowing information to be processed and accessible to you at a faster rate. Data Disclosure Under no circumstance will we disclose your data to any third-parties for any reason. Your data is only accessible by Countr bot representatives (referred to henceforth as “Representatives”). Representatives may include administrative and support staff who have a legitimate interest in assisting you.\nGenerally, your data will not be modified without informed consent, though there may be exceptional circumstances where there is a requirement due to misuse or maintain continuity of Countr.\nAmendments, omissions or other changes made to the database directly can only be enacted by the Bot Creator.\nRequest for Data Erasure If you wish to clear any and all stored information on a guild in which you have sufficient access, you may run the /data reset command, which will remove your guild from our database, effective immediately.\nIf you wish to clear any and all stored information about yourself (the user), you can contact the Data Controller at gdpr-request@countr.xyz.\nWe are unable to delete information about a guild that you do not have sufficient administrative access in. We will also refuse to delete information about other users through you as a proxy. They must approach us on behalf of themselves.\nChanges to These Terms Promise Solutions may apply amendments, omissions, or addendums to this Privacy Policy at any time, for whatever, or no, reason.

Queries about this Editorial Policy should be directed in the first instance to [REDACTED]. When referring to a particular part of this Editorial Policy, reference should be made to paragraph numbers (i.e., this is Paragraph 3). Our Values [REDACTED] asserts that it will adhere to the principles of objectivity, impartiality and integrity. Any articles or newsletters published by us will be written in a way that does not intentionally influence the reader’s viewpoint on a topic in one way or another. Instead, articles and newsletters should communicate multiple viewpoints where possible, and should equally balance arguments where applicable to ensure readers can make their own judgments as appropriate. We recognise the importance of editorial independence - if there is a conflict of interest between a writer and an organisation or individual discussed in an article, this must be disclosed in the public interest and for transparency purposes.

It is often, but not always, preceded by self-injurious behaviour and previous non-fatal suicide attempts, as shown in Figure 1 [omitted], also further contextualised by the contents of this paper. The World Health Organization (2021) reports that over 700,000 people die by suicide each year. Despite this, the academic study of suicide is generally limited in its scope.\nNeurobiology is one of the ways humans can gain valuable insights into how the state of suicidality can arise, and by identifying what the suicidal brain looks like, it is possible to devise potential treatments, for example, by way of pharmacological means (i.e., authorised drugs). Neurobiology can be used to devise predictors of suicide, which is essential towards prevention.\nThe definitions of the titular terms of this paper must be made clear to contextualise the concepts that will be explored. The National Institute of Mental Health (2023) defines the term ‘suicide’ as ‘death caused by self-directed injurious behaviour with intent to die as a result of the behaviour’. Comparatively, there is no universally agreed definition as to what ‘suicidal ideation’ constitutes, but the broad definition that is accepted for the purposes of this research paper is, ‘a range of contemplations, wishes, and preoccupations with death and suicide’ (Harmer et al., 2021).\nThis paper aims to explore major findings within neuroscience, and, specifically, biological developments with relation to suicide and suicidal ideation. Additionally, it brings to light the fundamental limitations of neuroscience and why suicidology, as an academic discipline, is difficult to explore empirically rather than theoretically.\nA summary of the existing research is needed before proceeding, which will be satisfied by the literature review after this introduction. Before the brain can be explored with its central relevance to suicide and associated treatments that derive from our understanding of it, the theoretical basis of the formation of suicidal thoughts must be given consideration through the stress-diathesis model. This paper will then discuss the serotonergic system and its involvement in suicidality. After, it will discuss imaging studies of the brain and how these have contributed to preventative efforts. Predictive coding also plays a major role in suicide as it relates to the cognitive framework humans have about the world around them, and how these can be distorted when suicide risk factors are present. The field of neuroscience, while at the highest point it has ever been, is limited about how scientific methodologies can be used to make advancements in research, both with relevance to suicide specifically and on a more general level. This will be discussed as the penultimate point. Finally, conclusions will be made about how neuroscientific developments thus far have advanced suicide research.\nLiterature Review In 1986, Donald H. Rubinstein published a stress-diathesis theory of suicide, which recognises the roles of both nature and nurture as contributors to the formulation of a suicidal state. That is to say that, to some extent, humans are predisposed to risk of suicide based on their DNA and hereditary factors, while at the same time, our upbringing and the environment that surrounds us contribute to this risk. Rubinstein recognised that it seemed wholly antithetical that the brain would allow for self-destructive behaviour, in recognition of the human species’ evolutionary instinct to stay alive that has developed over millions of years. The stress-diathesis theory of suicide is intended to explain how such a deviation can be explained scientifically.\nThis stress-diathesis theory of suicide was further developed by Mann and Arango (1992), who created a stress-diathesis model of suicide which aimed to integrate neurobiology and psychopathology into a cohesive model. It includes the relationship of psychopathological factors such as severity of depression and anxiety. Jollant et al. (2008) later investigated a stress-diathesis model by using participants with previous suicide attempts and non-suicidal controls (i.e., people who do not have diagnosed psychiatric disorders). Suicide attempters showed greater activity in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex and decreased activity in the right superior frontal gyrus in response to angry versus neutral faces. This supports the explanation that suicidal behaviour is characterised by abnormalities in the brain.\nVan Heeringen (2018) summarised the most major developments in brain neuroimaging studies relating to suicide in his book, The Neuroscience of Suicidal Behavior, including, but not limited to, the role of serotonin in the suicidal state, grey and white matter lesions and imaging of risk factors, some of which are more prominent in children as their brains are not fully developed.\nMarkram (2013) investigated the limitations of the field of neuroscience. It is notable that limitations are expressed in terms of neuroscience rather than neurobiology specifically, as they are more general, and specificity would not be helpful as they could apply equally to related fields such as neurochemistry. The single most important limitation is the simulation of the brain and how this is a task that is increasingly difficult, even as humanity’s knowledge of the brain continues to increase.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n","date":"2023-09-07","id":10,"permalink":"/docs/portfolio/personal-writing/extended-project-qualification-essay-sample/","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"callout callout-note d-flex flex-row mt-4 mb-4 pt-4 pe-4 pb-2 ps-3\"\u003e\r\n  \u003csvg\n  xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n  width=\"24\"\n  height=\"24\"\n  viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n  fill=\"none\"\n  stroke=\"currentColor\"\n  stroke-width=\"2\"\n  stroke-linecap=\"round\"\n  stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\n \n class=\"outline/info-circle svg-inline callout-icon me-2 mb-3\" id=\"svg-info-circle\" role=\"img\"\u003e\n  \u003cpath stroke=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"none\"/\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 1 0 18 0a9 9 0 0 0 -18 0\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M12 9h.01\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M11 12h1v4h1\" /\u003e\n\u003c/svg\u003e\r\n  \u003cdiv class=\"callout-content\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv class=\"callout-title\"\u003e\r\n        \u003cp\u003eNote\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"Extended Project Qualification Essay Sample"},{"content":"The portfolio available on this area of the website includes a number of documents produced under contract for clients as to represent my writing ability.

You should ask for clarification about anything that is unclear or that causes confusion.\nViolations of any of these regulations may result in disciplinary action such as a formal warning or removal from the team in serious circumstances, though this will usually be preceded by an informal reminder of our expectations for members exercising the responsibilities of a staff position.\nThese guidelines and regulations may be changed at any time. You can expect to be notified about significant changes, so you are aware of them before they come into effect and enforcement begins.\nStaff Guidelines \u0026amp; Regulations Staff members are subject to the same rules that normal users are. You are expected to enforce the rules, so it only makes sense that you should also follow them to the greatest extent. Avoid punitive action where it is not necessary. You should only issue formal punishments (i.e., warnings, mutes, kicks and bans) when it is the most appropriate remedial action and no other response would suffice in comparison to the offence. Do not leak or disseminate any confidential information. This includes any and all information sent in channels that are restricted to staff members of the server. Where you believe certain information is of the public interest to have knowledge of, you should seek advice from a senior staff member for advice. Do not argue with staff members in public channels. It is important that we are seen as a unified whole to the user base. While it is acceptable to disagree with a staff member on a matter of moderation, you should express this disagreement in a private environment, which would mean either in a staff channel or in Direct Messages (DMs). Use objectivity when deciding on punishments. You should issue punishments solely based on a user’s punishment history, the severity of the offence, and the impact, if any, it had on any other users. If you feel that you cannot reasonably exercise objectivity in regard to a certain user (for example, because you know them in real life), you should ask for another staff member to deal with the situation at hand. Communicate with staff members about anything you are unsure about. If there is a situation that you are not sure about how to respond to, you should seek the opinions of other online moderators to ensure that the decision made is as fair as possible. This may also help with consistency across moderation within our team. Be proactive in moderation, not reactive. You should be conscious of what you are saying in public channels, especially when they might instigate an argument. Steer conversations in a different direction if you know they are getting heated. Notify senior staff members about any extended leave of absences. There is nothing wrong with taking an extended break for whatever reason, but we ask that you notify us beforehand so we know you are still wanting to retain your position. Do not discuss Discord or Minecraft punishments in public channels. There is no need to publicise case information, especially where it may degrade the quality of ongoing conversation. You should encourage users to communicate with you privately if they wish to dispute or discuss a punishment. Permissions should be used in the way that they are intended to be used. For example, nicknames should only be applied to users when they have an inappropriate username or non-alphanumeric characters in them. Try to regularly participate in conversations on the server. While by no means is activity tracked, you should make an effort to participate in public channels in the Discord server whenever you can. It is important for staff members to be fully integrated into the community. Cooperate with internal reviews of cases. In certain situations, you may have one or more of your decisions challenged by a senior staff member. This is not to doubt your competence, but to understand your thought process in reaching a decision.

You should ask for clarification about anything that is unclear or that causes confusion.\nThese guidelines and regulations may be changed at any time. You can expect to be notified about significant changes, so you are aware of them before they come into effect and enforcement begins.\nStaff Guidelines \u0026amp; Regulations Staff members are subject to the same rules that normal users are. You are expected to enforce the rules, so it only makes sense that you should also follow them to the greatest extent. As a staff member, you are held to a higher standard in terms of behaviour towards users. Even if you dislike a user for whatever reason, you should treat them with dignity and respect. You should not use any staff privileges to give yourself an unfair advantage over other users. Any permissions that are given to you are solely to fulfil your responsibilities as a staff member. Using permissions to further progression of yourself or other users will result in disciplinary action. You should make an active effort to help out users with queries whenever possible, especially where other users are not doing so. This increases trust in the staff team and increases user retention. Avoid punitive action where it is not necessary. You should only issue formal punishments (i.e., warnings, mutes, kicks and bans) when it is the most appropriate remedial action and no other response would suffice in comparison to the offence. Do not argue with staff members in chat. It is important that we are seen as a unified whole to the user base. While it is acceptable to disagree with a staff member on a matter of moderation, you should express this disagreement in a private environment, which would mean in a private communication channel (like on Discord). Use objectivity when deciding on punishments. You should issue punishments solely based on a user’s punishment history, the severity of the offence, and the impact, if any, it had on any other users. If you feel that you cannot reasonably exercise objectivity in regard to a certain user (for example, because you know them in real life), you should ask for another staff member to deal with the situation at hand. Communicate with staff members about anything you are unsure about. If there is a situation that you are not sure about how to respond to, you should seek the opinions of other online moderators to ensure that the decision made is as fair as possible. This may also help with consistency across moderation within our team. Be proactive in moderation, not reactive. You should be conscious of what you are saying in chat, especially when they might instigate an argument. Steer conversations in a different direction if you know they are getting heated. Notify senior staff members about any extended leave of absences. There is nothing wrong with taking an extended break for whatever reason, but we ask that you notify us beforehand so we know you are still wanting to retain your position. Do not discuss Discord or Minecraft punishments in public channels. There is no need to publicise case information, especially where it may degrade the quality of ongoing conversation. You should encourage users to communicate with you privately if they wish to dispute or discuss a punishment. Permissions should be used in the way that they are intended to be used. For example, nicknames should only be applied to users when they have an inappropriate username or non-alphanumeric characters in them. Cooperate with internal reviews of cases. In certain situations, you may have one or more of your decisions challenged by a senior staff member. This is not to doubt your competence, but to understand your thought process in reaching a decision. As such, you should be prepared to defend your position with evidence and conclusions derived from this evidence. Above all else, use common sense. Your decision-making, when not guided by predefined rules, should be based on your common sense. You should act in a way that a reasonable person would in those specific circumstances. Responding to Situations Requiring Moderation We understand that some scenarios requiring moderation may be difficult to deal with and a solution is not imminently clear. However, you are expected to exercise your best judgement and common sense. You should ensure that your reactions to situations (including punishments) are wholly proportionate to the offence committed. They should also be consistent across users to eliminate bias. There are no specific regulations for what you should do for each and every scenario. You should exercise your sense of logic and common sense, as previously mentioned, when deciding what is appropriate. Context is also incredibly important, too. If a user was aggravated into saying something they otherwise would not have said, the punishment may be less severe than it would if they were otherwise unprompted, for example. Punishment reasons inputted should be straightforward, objective, and understandable. They should not be overly long or include anything indicative of bias. If there are multiple reasons for a punishment, you should ideally separate them with a semicolon. See the table below for an example of what to and what not to do. Appropriate Reason Inappropriate Reason Hostility; failure to follow instructions from staff You are being banned for being hostile to other users and not listening to staff Punishments should only ever be issued where they are in reaction to an offence committed. They should never be issued jokingly or to demonstrate your ‘power’ on the server. This is considered a serious violation of these regulations and guidelines. You should not taunt users with any permissions you have, especially with regard to moderation abilities to intimidate or threaten anyone. It is okay to make mistakes. If you issue a punishment to the wrong user by mistake, or issue the wrong type of punishment accidentally, do not panic. Reverse the action and offer your apologies to the user where possible. Alternatively, ask for assistance from a senior staff member if you feel you are not sure exactly how to rectify the situation. In these situations, you will be talked to about how future mistakes can be avoided and use this towards continuing your development as a staff member.
