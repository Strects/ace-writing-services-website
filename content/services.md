The writing service is recommended where you would like new documents to be produced from scratch to your specifications. With each order, you can order multiple documents of any length or complexity.

A finalisation date will be recommended based on my availability and other commitments. You are able to bring the finalisation date forward as early as 24 hours after signing the contract for an additional charge.

{{< tab "Proofreading" >}}

For comparatively lower prices, you can order proofreading services where any number of documents provided by yourself are professionally proofread to make comprehensive improvements to style, grammar and syntax.

For an additional charge, you can also  be provided with an annotated version of the provided document(s) that outlines specifically what changes were made and why.
