## Section 1: Introduction

Ace Writing Services (“we”, “us”, “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of information of users who engage with our services.

This Privacy Policy applies to interactions with our website at [https://acewritingservices.co.uk](https://acewritingservices.co.uk) and communications with the freelance writer, Yaman Choudhury, via the bot in our Discord server. These are controlled and managed by Ace Writing Services.

This Privacy Policy sets out the specific terms and conditions under which your data is stored and controlled, as well as the conditions under which your data is retained. It further outlines your rights in relation to data that is about you and how you can exercise those rights.

We will not use personal data that you provide to us in a manner inconsistent with the purposes for which you provided it to us, as set out in this Privacy Policy.

You are automatically bound by this Privacy Policy as a user of this website and as a client by entering into a Service Level Agreement with the freelance writer via Ace Writing Services.

## Section 2: What Data We Collect

Personal information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person ("Personal Information").

Ace Writing Services may collect the following Personal Information from you through interacting with our Discord server and communicating with the freelance writer:

- **Discord Username**
- **Discord Identifier (ID)**: This uniquely identifies your account;
- **Message Content**: We may retain messages you send to us via the bot in our Discord server as a record of communications. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, 'Message Content' includes attachments such as images or videos. Messages within the server itself may be subject to logging events enabled by a moderation bot, such as detecting and tracking message edits and deletions.

You must be at least thirteen (13) years of age to join the Discord server in line with Discord’s Terms of Service. You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age to be able to pay for services through PayPal, in accordance with PayPal’s Terms of Service.

If you communicate with Ace Writing Services, we may collect information relating to that communication whether it takes the form of email, letter, or any other form of communication.

We may also collect data in a form that does not allow for direct association with any specific individual.

## Section 3: Payment Information and Transactions

When making a payment for services provided by us, information that is submitted by you is handled and stored by PayPal. More information on external providers is available in Section 7 (“Scope and Limitations”).

Information provided to PayPal to allow for transactions to be made cannot be accessed by Ace Writing Services and we cannot be held liable for any losses that may be incurred as a result of failing to check that information provided is correct and accurate at the time of submission.

## Section 4: How We Process Your Data

For our legitimate interests, including to:

- allow for you to use our services to their fullest capacity;
- enforce the terms of our services;
- manage our everyday needs, such as monitoring and analysing usage; and
- manage risk and abuse of the services.

We may also use your data in the following ways:

- to administer our website;
- to respond to any communications, queries or requests for information or services from you;
- for auditing purposes;
- to comply with legal or regulatory obligations; and
- to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

Your data is held and managed securely and is only accessible to the freelance writer via accounts that are secured by a strong password and two-factor authentication (2FAa). As a client, information about the specific services used for your order will be specified in your personalised Service Level Agreement.

## Section 5: Data Correction and Erasure

You have the right to have your data removed from our databases forever, with exceptions. To exercise your right to have your data deleted from our systems, you must submit a request [here](https://forms.fillout.com/t/swnXawJuT5us). Requests to have your data corrected should also be submitted via the same form.

After processing a data erasure request, we are unable to fulfil any requests to reverse this. You do not need to provide a reason to request to have your data deleted.

Ace Writing Services reserves the right to refuse a request to delete a user’s data, for example, in instances where information would be needed to defend our legal position on a matter.

You do not have the right to ask for someone else’s data to be deleted, even if that data is connected to yours in one way or another.

## Section 6: Data Disclosure

If you would like to access data about yourself, you should submit a request [here](https://forms.fillout.com/t/swnXawJuT5us). Ace Writing Services reserves the right to withhold data about you if the disclosure of this data would compromise the interests of the business. We will generally provide a reason where disclosure of data is refused.
