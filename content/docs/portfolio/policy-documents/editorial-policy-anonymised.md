## Effective Date
10 August 2024

## Introduction

1. This document has been written by [REDACTED] to document our approach to how articles and newsletters should be approached from an editorial perspective.
2. Queries about this Editorial Policy should be directed in the first instance to [REDACTED].
3. When referring to a particular part of this Editorial Policy, reference should be made to paragraph numbers (i.e., this is Paragraph 3).

## Our Values

4. [REDACTED] asserts that it will adhere to the principles of objectivity, impartiality and integrity.
5. Any articles or newsletters published by us will be written in a way that does not intentionally influence the readerâ€™s viewpoint on a topic in one way or another.
6. Instead, articles and newsletters should communicate multiple viewpoints where possible, and should equally balance arguments where applicable to ensure readers can make their own judgments as appropriate.
7. We recognise the importance of editorial independence - if there is a conflict of interest between a writer and an organisation or individual discussed in an article, this must be disclosed in the public interest and for transparency purposes.

## Accessibility Commitment

8. As part of our mission, we want everyone to be able to access our publications with ease. As such, we promise to use English in a way that can be accessed by as many people as possible. This extends beyond using simple wording where anything more complicated would be unnecessary - it also includes using accessible sentence structures. This also helps with readability.
9. We would like to hear from our readers about any publications that are not accessible - even the small things are important so we can be sure to make improvements to new releases as we continue to develop our brand and voice.

## Referencing & Sources

10. While [REDACTED] is not compelled or required by any means to declare our sources of information through referencing or otherwise, we may do so anyway in instances where certain information is specialist in nature or where our writers have made a determination that it is unlikely to be widely known.
11. We assert that we will thoroughly consider the nature, origin and purpose of any sources and whether information derived from these sources is reliable and fit to be included in one of our publications.

## Copyright & Regulatory Compliance

12. [REDACTED] is committed to ensuring that any copyrighted materials used in published articles or newsletters are appropriately attributed to their respective owners.
13. Pursuant to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 with the legal extent of England and Wales (s.304), fair dealing for criticism, review or quotation is allowed for any type of copyright work
14. However, it is not permitted for photographs. As such, [REDACTED] will seek permission to reproduce photographs where this is possible.

## Reporting Breaches

15. We are committed to protecting our integrity and reputation as a reliable source of information on the topic of aeronautics.
16. Accordingly, if you feel we have fallen short of our editorial standards as set out above, you are welcome and encouraged to contact us at [REDACTED] and we will aim to respond to you within a reasonable timeframe.
17. In response to any complaints, we will provide a response that details what we have done to rectify the problem if we agree that there has been a breach of this policy, or, in some situations, we will provide reasons to justify our original decision.

## Changes to This Policy

18. [REDACTED] reserves the right to make additions, amendments or omissions to this Editorial Policy at any time, for any reason, with or without notice.
19. Where significant changes are made, [REDACTED] assures you that it will make every reasonable effort to communicate this to you via email, usually thirty (30) days before changes take effect.
