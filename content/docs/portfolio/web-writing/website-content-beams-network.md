## **Content for ‘Welcome’ Section**

Welcome to the Beams Network Store.

Please click on one of the server options on the left-hand side to access purchasable items. You will be able to see exactly what you will get before you buy it!

It is recommended that you read the entirety of this information before making any purchases so you are fully aware of our agreement.

## **Refunds**

By purchasing an item through the Store, you are acknowledging that the sale is final and there is no available option to have your money refunded, under any circumstance.

In the instance that there has been an issue with payment, please open a ticket in our Discord server at [https://discord.beams.gg](https://discord.beams.gg/), where we will be happy to assist you.

## **Important Information**
