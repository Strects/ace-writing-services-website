## Document Overview

Project Blurple (“we”, “us” or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of information (i.e. any information relating to an identified or identifiable user) who interact with the Blurplefied Discord bot and use the services available therein (the “Services”). Amendments to this Privacy Policy will be posted to the Services and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of the services following the posting of any amendment to this Privacy Policy hereinafter shall constitute your acceptance of aforementioned amendment.

The Data Controller constitutes Discord user [REDACTED] as well as the following:

- Project Lead [REDACTED]
- Project Lead [REDACTED]
- Project Lead [REDACTED]

Data Controllers have access to the User’s information stored through the bot and may be able to view, manipulate and delete database information as they wish, within reason. If, for whatever reason, you do not wish for any or all of these users to manage your data, we request that you do not interact with the Blurplefied bot to avoid any data collection.

Project Blurple server moderators may have elevated access to some information that otherwise wouldn’t be available to a regular user. This includes server submission information. They have access to this information to accept or deny your server accordingly, and for no other reason. Antecedent server submissions may be saved to a database for purposes of abuse prevention. Circumstantial evidence will not be accepted for any reports of breaches of confidentiality.

This loosely binding Privacy Policy was written by an authorised representative for Project Blurple. If you have any questions about our privacy practices or about any ambiguities in this document, please contact us through sending a Direct Message on Discord to [REDACTED]. Your request will be forwarded to the Data Controllers or the legal writer accordingly, entirely dependent upon whichever is most appropriate.

## What user data do we collect?

We collect User Data about you when you use our Services, including the following:

- **User information, including the following, to exhaustive capacity:**
    - your User identifier if you interact with the bot;
    - your Username and Discriminator if you interact with the bot;
    - the amount of Paint or other virtual currencies you may have;
    - servers you have submitted for the purposes of listing the server and being able to provide a denial reason in the case that it does not meet our standards.
- **Guild (‘server’) information, including the following, to exhaustive capacity, collected for analytical and review purposes:**
    - guild identifier when our internal storage databases are modified, usually as per command invocation by a User of our Services.
    - guild icon;
    - guild name.

## How We Process User Data

**For our legitimate interests, including to:**

- enforce the terms of our Services;
- manage our everyday needs, such as monitoring and analysing usage;
- manage risk and abuse of the Blurplefied bot.

All user and Guild information that is available to Blurplefied Data Controllers/’maintainers’ will only ever be internally accessed. We do not sell or transmit data to third-party aggregates under any condition imagined. For the avoidance of doubt, disclosure of information will never be facilitated without prior permission from all involved Users of our Services.

By using Blurplefied and interacting with the bot in any sense, you hereby accept and understand with absolution what we store and how we use the collected data, as defined in this Privacy Policy, to satisfy both our interests and your own as the User of our Services.

By inviting our bot, Blurplefied, to your server(s), you agree that your server does not violate [Discord’s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) You are assumed liability for any applicable damages caused at any point hereafter the bot being added to a server you have the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission node on. We reserve the right to remove our bot from a server for any reason at any time, either with perpetual or temporary implications on any or all associated users.

## Request for Erasure of Data

As a User of our Services, you are afforded the right to have your data removed from our database perpetually. It is a non-negotiable condition that by having your data erased, all servers submitted to the event through your account will be dissociated. Furthermore, all virtual currencies attached to your account will be reset to 0. After processing of a data erasure request, we will not fulfil any efforts of reversion, for this is an act that will not be reconsidered after being received. You may only request a data erasure request once per 30 days. Requests for user data may be granted but are not bound by absolution.
