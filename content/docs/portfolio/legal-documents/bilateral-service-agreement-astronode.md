## Introduction
This Service Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into by and between the Client and *Hiun LLC*, doing business as *AstroNode* (referred to hereafter as the “Service Provider”), also referred to collectively as the “Parties”. 

## Services
Pursuant to this bilateral Agreement coming into force upon completion of the fields in the “Signature” clause, the Service Provider is bound to provide the following services:

1. Completion of day-to-day tasks and activities, inclusive of, but not limited to;


    a. leading operational management;

    b. leading systems management;

    c. leading the handling of support inquiries;

    d. handling customer data.

2. Managing financial information to support the legitimate interests of the Service Provider, including billing;
3. Taxes will need to be paid on an annual basis, in similitude with ArtI.S8.C1.1.1 of the United States Constitution, of which the funds will be required to be paid to the Service Provider by the Client;
4. Resolution of all issues relating to WHMCS (web hosting management and billing software).

## Standard of Work
In providing the services to the Client, the Service Provider:

- shall exercise reasonable skill, care and diligence and shall apply the highest professional standards;
- shall be wholly communicative and honest with the Client about any delays or hindrances that will affect the completion of daily activities and the delivery of services as defined in Clause 2 (entitled “Services”);
- shall do nothing which is likely to bring the Client into disrepute or which is materially contrary to the interests of the Client.

## Remuneration
The Service Provider should be paid in the amount of $150.00 by medium of PayPal by the Client on a monthly basis, where “monthly” constitutes every thirty (30) days.

Failure to remunerate the Service Provider satisfies breach of contract, and, as such, will result in termination of the Agreement, taking effect with immediacy.

## Confidentiality
The Client agrees to keep confidential all matters contained in this Agreement or relating to the research or affairs of the Service Provider, and not to disclose any such matters to any person.

The Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S. Code § 41 et seq.), in principle, empowers the United States Federal Trade Commision (FTC) to bring enforcement actions to protect consumers against unfair or deceptive practices. In accordance with this, the Service Provider agrees to handle data with respect to the following specifications:

1. The Service Provider will use data to fulfill the legitimate corporate interests of AstroNode;
2. The Service Provider will use data for statistical analysis;
3. The Service Provider will not disclose any data to any third-parties for any reason;
4. The Service Provider agrees that they will handle data sensitively and effectively, ensuring that appropriate protections are in place to avoid any data being released with or without intent to do so.

## Indemnification
The Service Provider shall indemnify the Client from any and all claims, causes of action, suits, damages or demands, arising out of any infringement of intellectual property rights used by the Service Provider in the course of delivering the services as defined and specified under the “Services” clause.

## Dispute Resolution and Remedies
The Parties aforementioned in this Agreement shall initially attempt to resolve all claims, disputes or controversies arising under, out of or in connection with this Agreement by conducting good faith negotiations amongst themselves in mutual confidence. If the Parties are unable to resolve the matter following good faith negotiations, the matter shall thereafter be resolved by binding arbitration.

## Termination
Either party may terminate the Agreement at any time upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other Party. 

In the event the Client terminates the Agreement, the Client shall still remain obligated to pay the Service Provider for any services performed up to the date of termination and any expenses approved, but not paid, prior to the date of termination. 

In the event the Service Provider terminates the Agreement, the Service Provider shall reimburse the Client any amounts previously paid to the Service Provider for which the Service Provider has not yet performed the services.

## Signatures
For this agreement to take legal effect, both involved parties must provide their signatures, print their name, and acknowledge the date of signing. The date should be formatted DD/MM/YYYY. The Parties should print their names in BLOCK CAPITALS and the AstroNode representative’s job title should also be in BLOCK CAPITALS.
