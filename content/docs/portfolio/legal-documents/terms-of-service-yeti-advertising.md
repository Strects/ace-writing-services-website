## Section 1: Introduction

Please read these Terms of Service (these "Terms") carefully as they govern your use of Yeti Advertising (the “Bot”), an application on the Discord platform.

Use of Yeti Advertising is subject to additional terms and conditions presented by Yeti Advertising (the “Service Provider”), which have been incorporated into these Terms.

By using Yeti Advertising or by otherwise interacting with it in any way, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use the Bot in any capacity.

## Section 2: Purpose of the Service

Yeti Advertising is a Discord bot application that is used to aggregate a list of servers for the purpose of users discovering them and becoming a part of their communities.

By adding the Bot to a server that you own or have the ‘Manage Server’ permission in, you agree to the Bot collecting information on the server like its name, description, unique identifier, icon, the server’s owner, and how many members it has.

This information will be used only for the purpose of listing the server and determining eligibility. Further, this information may be made publicly accessible to satisfy both your interests and the interests of the Service Provider.

You agree that the Service Provider may terminate the presence of your server in a published list at any time, for any reason, or no reason. This reason will be communicated to you within a reasonable timeframe, though this may not always be the case.

You agree that the Service Provider may collect your user identifier (ID) for the purposes of restricting your access to the Bot (‘blacklisting’) if the Service Provider determines it necessary.

The Service Provider reserves the right to terminate the presence of a server in an advertising list if its name, its icon or the name of its owner is in any way a violation of Discord’s Terms of Service or Community Guidelines. You can access these at [https://discord.com/terms](https://discord.com/terms) and [https://discord.com/guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) respectively. As the Service Provider, we encourage you to read these fully so you have a full understanding of why we may terminate your access to the service.

## Section 3: Availability of Service

The Service Provider cannot assuredly guarantee that you will have continuous uninterrupted access to the Bot. For whatever reason, at any time, the Bot may be made unavailable for maintenance or may unexpectedly stop responding to user-invoked instructions (commands).

You must also be aware that unavailability may sometimes be out of the control of the Bot’s maintainers and could instead be reliant on Discord’s Application Programming Interface (API) having an outage. In these instances, the Service Provider will make every reasonable effort to notify its users.

Alternatively, the Service Provider reserves the right to temporarily or permanently revoke access to the Bot, including within context to  servers, channels, and users, for any, or no, reason. This can happen where a user’s interactions with the Bot have been determined to be with malicious aforethought, and if their access to the Bot remained, there may have been an existing threat to the upkeep of the Bot or the safety of its users.

## Section 4: Professional Standards & Responsibility

As the Service Provider, we will act with professionalism and will aim to resolve any disputes with you amicably. We can be held to the standard that our support representatives and any associated officials will respond to queries with their best knowledge on the topic and will approach senior representatives if any disambiguation is required. Likewise, we expect that you will respect our support representatives and all officials that represent the Service Provider.

The Service Provider absolves itself of any responsibility with regard to user-generated content (UGC). This includes server icons, server names, server descriptions, and all other applicable UGC that users of the Bot may be exposed to in any way. You should report inappropriate content both to Discord at [https://discord.gd/contact](https://discord.gd/contact) and to the Service Provider at **trust@yetiadvertising.com**.

## Section 5: Changes to These Terms

The Service Provider may apply amendments, omissions, or addendums to this Terms of Service document at any time, for whatever, or no, reason. The Service Provider will make every reasonable effort to notify its users of significant changes to these Terms. Minor amendments, omissions, or addendums may not be announced in an official capacity.

## Section 6: Right to Disambiguation

You have the right to disambiguation, meaning that you can ask us for clarification about anything mentioned in this document and we can explain to you what it means in more accessible terms. You can contact us at **trust@yetiadvertising.com**.

## Section 7: Termination

Both you and the Service Provider have been granted the right to terminate these Terms at any time, for whatever, or no reason, without consequence. This does not invalidate any actions that may have been performed prior to the activation of the Termination clause. Terminating this agreement also means that the Service Provider reserves the right to revoke your access to the Bot.
